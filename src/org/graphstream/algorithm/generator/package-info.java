/**
 * Various graph generators with specific properties.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Graph generators are classes that can be used as iterators, but instead of
 * iterating on already existing elements, they create them on the fly. Often
 * the more one iterates on the generator, the larger the graph becomes. Some
 * generator are finite, whereas others are not.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Generators have very few methods (apart from the generation parameter setup
 * methods that are specific to each generator). They are:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>{@link org.graphstream.algorithm.generator.Generator#begin()}
 * 			to start the generation of elements in the given graph. This graph
 * 			may or not already contain elements.</li>
 * 		<li>{@link org.graphstream.algorithm.generator.Generator#nextElement()}
 * 			to generate one or a set of elements in the graph. The more this
 * 			method is iterated, the more the graph grows. This method returns
 * 			false when no more elements can be generated. BE CAREFUL: some
 * 			generators never return false: they can generate graphs of arbitrary
 * 			size.</li>
 * 		<li>{@link org.graphstream.algorithm.generator.Generator#end()} to
 * 			finish the graph generation process, either once
 * 			{@link org.graphstream.algorithm.generator.Generator#nextElement()}
 * 			returned false, or one chooses to stop the generation process.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
